This repo contains the source code for running a local
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that interacts with APIs for
[Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics).

## Tools 🛠️

The server uses the
[Google Analytics Admin API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1)
and
[Google Analytics Data API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1)
to provide several
[Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) for use with LLMs.

### Retrieve account and property information 🟠

- `get_account_summaries`: Retrieves information about the user's Google
  Analytics accounts and properties.
- `get_property_details`: Returns details about a property.
- `list_google_ads_links`: Returns a list of links to Google Ads accounts for
  a property.

### Run core reports 📙

- `run_report`: Runs a Google Analytics report using the Data API.
- `get_custom_dimensions_and_metrics`: Retrieves the custom dimensions and
  metrics for a specific property.

### Run realtime reports ⏳

- `run_realtime_report`: Runs a Google Analytics realtime report using the
  Data API.

## Setup instructions 🔧

✨ Watch the [Google Analytics MCP Setup
Tutorial](https://youtu.be/nS8HLdwmVlY) on YouTube for a step-by-step
walkthrough of these instructions.

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nS8HLdwmVlY/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS8HLdwmVlY)

Setup involves the following steps:

1.  Configure Python.
1.  Configure credentials for Google Analytics.
1.  Configure Gemini.

### Configure Python 🐍

[Install pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#install-pipx).

The repository now provides two server entry points:

- `analytics-mcp` for the existing `stdio` transport used by local MCP clients.
- `analytics-mcp-http` for `streamable_http`, useful when you want to expose
  the server on a host and port for other machines on your LAN.

### Enable APIs in your project ✅

[Follow the instructions](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841)
to enable the following APIs in your Google Cloud project:

* [Google Analytics Admin API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/analyticsadmin.googleapis.com)
* [Google Analytics Data API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/analyticsdata.googleapis.com)

### Configure credentials 🔑

Configure your [Application Default Credentials
(ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).
Make sure the credentials are for a user with access to your Google Analytics
accounts or properties.

Credentials must include the Google Analytics read-only scope:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly
```

Check out
[Manage OAuth Clients](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257)
for how to create an OAuth client.

Here are some sample `gcloud` commands you might find useful:

- Set up ADC using user credentials and an OAuth desktop or web client after
  downloading the client JSON to `YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE`.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \
    --client-id-file=YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE
  ```

- Set up ADC using service account impersonation.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --impersonate-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
  ```

When the `gcloud auth application-default` command completes, copy the
`PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` file location printed to the console in the
following message. You'll need this for the next step!

```
Credentials saved to file: [PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON]
```

### Configure Gemini

1.  Install [Gemini
    CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/index.md)
    or [Gemini Code
    Assist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.geminicodeassist).

1.  Create or edit the file at `~/.gemini/settings.json`, adding your server
    to the `mcpServers` list.

    Replace `PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` with the path you copied in the previous
    step.

    We also recommend that you add a `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` attribute to the
    `env` object. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` in the following example with the
    [project ID](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113) of your
    Google Cloud project.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "analytics-mcp": {
          "command": "pipx",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "analytics-mcp"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON",
            "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Troubleshooting installation

If you see an error like the following:

```python
ImportError: cannot import name 'admin_v1beta' from 'google.analytics'
```

your Python environment is missing the `google-analytics-admin` package, or
the repo dependencies were not installed into the interpreter you are using.

To fix it, install the project dependencies with the same Python interpreter
you will use to run the server:

```shell
/Users/shiwen/.pyenv/versions/codex/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then verify the import:

```shell
/Users/shiwen/.pyenv/versions/codex/bin/python -c "from google.analytics import admin_v1beta; print(admin_v1beta)"
```

This project is tested in CI on Python 3.10 through 3.13. If you are using
Python 3.14+, switch to a supported version first when troubleshooting
dependency import failures.

### Run streamable HTTP

To run a networked MCP endpoint instead of the default `stdio` process, set
the HTTP settings in your environment and start the dedicated HTTP entry point:

```shell
export SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
export SERVER_PORT=8000
export SERVER_PATH=/mcp
/Users/shiwen/.pyenv/versions/codex/bin/python -m analytics_mcp.server_streamable_http
```

You can also use the installed script:

```shell
analytics-mcp-http
```

The HTTP entry point also reads a local `.env` file from the repository root,
so `SERVER_HOST`, `SERVER_PORT`, and `SERVER_PATH` can be configured there
without exporting them in your shell.

If your machine's LAN IP is `192.168.1.100`, the MCP endpoint will be
available at `http://192.168.1.100:8000/mcp`.

## Try it out 🥼

Launch Gemini Code Assist or Gemini CLI and type `/mcp`. You should see
`analytics-mcp` listed in the results.

Here are some sample prompts to get you started:

- Ask what the server can do:

  ```
  what can the analytics-mcp server do?
  ```

- Ask about a Google Analytics property

  ```
  Give me details about my Google Analytics property with 'xyz' in the name
  ```

- Prompt for analysis:

  ```
  what are the most popular events in my Google Analytics property in the last 180 days?
  ```

- Ask about signed-in users:

  ```
  were most of my users in the last 6 months logged in?
  ```

- Ask about property configuration:

  ```
  what are the custom dimensions and custom metrics in my property?
  ```
